# Distributed Logging System

## Project Overview

In a microservices architecture, effective log management is critical for maintaining operational excellence. This project introduces a **Distributed Logging System** that collects, stores, and analyzes logs generated by different services. By enabling real-time querying and monitoring of logs, the system improves operational visibility and helps identify potential issues, ensuring resilient and maintainable applications.

## System Components

1. **Microservices**: Distributed nodes that generate logs and send heartbeat signals to monitor status.
2. **Log Accumulator**: Collects and structures logs from each node, forwarding them to the Pub-Sub model.
3. **Pub-Sub Model**: Acts as a communication layer for asynchronous log distribution.
4. **Log Storage**: Stores indexed logs for easy access and monitoring.
5. **Alerting System**: Monitors critical log levels (e.g., ERROR, FATAL) and generates real-time alerts.
6. **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Detects node failures by monitoring heartbeat signals.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of multiple microservice nodes, each with its own **Log Accumulator**. Logs are forwarded to a central **Pub-Sub Model** that distributes them for storage and alerting. The **Log Storage** system indexes logs for easy searching, while the **Alerting System** handles critical errors. The **Heartbeat Mechanism** monitors node health and triggers alerts when failures occur.

## Key Features

- **Real-time log ingestion**: Centralized collection of logs from multiple nodes.
- **Efficient querying**: Logs are indexed for quick access and monitoring.
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for critical errors or node failures.
- **Scalable architecture**: Supports large-scale microservice applications with distributed logging.
